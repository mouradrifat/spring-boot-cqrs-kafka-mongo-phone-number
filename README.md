The main propose of this project is test CQRS with Event Sourcing.  This project consists in two spring boot microservices, one to command and other to query. Additionally we deploy and run docker containers for two Mongo databases, an Apache kafka message broker and Apache Zookeeper.

In the next diagram we can show how this project was designed:

# Starting üöÄ

## Requirements üìã
To install and run this project you may be installes next requirements:
- jdk8
- maven
- docker and docker-compose

## Installation üîß
To generate jar files run the following command in root path:

```bash
mvn clean package
```
Run containers of *Apache Kafka, Zoookeper and Mongo*.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Wait a minute, when you see all containers running yo can launch the Spring Boot microservices:

### Microservice for command
Run the following command:

```bash
java -jar demo-command/target/demo-command-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.original
```

### Microservice for query
In other terminal run the following command:

```bash
java -jar demo-query/target/demo-query-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.original
```

# Running project ‚öôÔ∏è
Once all microservice started you can test this service using the command endpoint and service endpoint. I show you one example for POST and GET http rest requests with curl command:

```
curl --location --request POST 'localhost:8081/phone' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "name": "iphone11",
    "model": "11",
    "color": "red",
    "price": 800.99
}'
```

```
curl --location --request GET 'localhost:8082/phone/iphone08'
```
